# Stock-Analysis

## Project Overview
This project focuses on predicting stock price changes using various machine learning models and feature engineering techniques. The goal is to analyze stock data, evaluate the influence of different features and technical indicators, and build a predictive model that can accurately forecast stock price movements.


## Data Collection
Source: Stock data was collected from Finviz
Parameters Used:
- Market Cap: Over 0.01
- Relative Volume: Over 2
- Current Volume: Over 100K
- Change: Up


## Data Collection Approach:
- Manual collection was performed using manual exports that fetched data every 15 minutes from 7:00 am to 10:00 am EST each business day.
- Data was manually collected and timestamped to reflect real-time stock movements.
- Data was saved onto personal Google Drive and converted to pandas dataframe for analysis


## Conclusion
This project demonstrates a comprehensive approach to stock price prediction by leveraging machine learning models and feature engineering techniques. The integration of time-series data with LSTM models, combined with the analysis of technical indicators and basic models, provides a robust framework for forecasting stock movements and assessing feature relevance.
